# Password-Generator

 The tittle of this repository says it all right? Well this is a program that generates a password.
 This was  more challenging to accomplish because it envolves working with JavaScript.
 This is the first my project in which JavaScript was used. The program has as main function generating a password.
 In order to do that some interaction is prodused between the user and the program. The program allows the user
 to choose numbers, upper or lower characters, etc to be part of the password.
Once again, VS Code sofware Version: 1.60.2 was used in the developent of this project along
with Google Chrome. Google Chrome Dveloper Tool is a powerful tool that was used in the prosess to achieve the final product.
